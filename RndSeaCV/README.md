# News Scraping For BBC

This project focuses on scraping news articles from a public news website of your choice wherein this case i have used BBC website which has its terms and conditions applied. The script collects approximately 100 news articles and categorizes them using the website's predefined classifications (e.g., sections like politics, business, technology). The primary goal is to assess the effectiveness of a text classification model in correctly categorizing news articles.
