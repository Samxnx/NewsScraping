"This video can not be played Changing of the Guard, Gangnam style In another sign of the King's K-pop diplomacy, the members of South Korean girl group Blackpink have been presented with honorary MBEs. It comes during the state visit by South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol, in which King Charles had praised the global reach of Korean pop culture. Blackpink were name-checked by the King for supporting environmental causes. ""I can only admire how they can prioritise these vital issues, as well as being global superstars,"" he said. The MBEs recognise how the girl group acted as ambassadors for the COP climate change summit during the UK's presidency, and have been advocates for the UN's sustainable development goals, helping to bring the environmental message to ""millions of young people"". There was a special investiture this morning in the 1844 room in Buckingham Palace, often used for the most distinguished guests. It was another reflection of the red carpet being rolled out during this South Korean state visit, with the diplomatic courtship reflecting the increasing importance of this strategic ally and economic partner. The members of Blackpink - Roseanne Park, Jennie Kim, Jisoo Kim and Lalisa Manoban - are now honorary members of the Order of the British Empire and were guests at the state banquet in Buckingham Palace on Tuesday evening. The King's speech had highlighted the global reach of South Korean popular culture and its ""remarkable ability to captivate imaginations"". While the King admitted to a personal lack of ""what might be called Gangnam Style"", the military band for the changing of the guard put that right on Wednesday morning, by playing the song in a surprise change of musical direction. Tourists gathered outside Buckingham Palace to watch changing of the guard had heard an unexpected medley of K-pop songs, rather than marching tunes. There had been a full ceremonial welcome for South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Tuesday - greeted by the King, Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, before taking part in a carriage procession along the Mall. In the evening, the president was given the grand spectacle of a state banquet, held in the Buckingham Palace ballroom, with 170 guests including the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron as well the Royal Family and South Korean dignitaries. State visits are a mix of serious diplomacy as well as pageantry - and the focus of the South Korean visit is on boosting trade links and military partnerships. South Korea's President Yoon is meeting Mr Sunak to sign a ""Downing Street Accord"", with plans for a new trade deal, with technology and green energy likely to be areas of co-operation. There are plans for a stronger approach to enforcing sanctions against North Korea, and preventing its ""illegal weapons programme"", with joint sea patrols between the South Korean navy and the UK's Royal Navy. ""Long term, global partnerships are vital to our prosperity and security,"" Mr Sunak said.

"A Russian actress has been killed in a Ukrainian strike while giving a performance to troops, according to her theatre. A dance hall in occupied Ukraine where Polina Menshikh was performing was hit by Ukrainian shelling on 19 November.  The actress was reportedly giving a show to celebrate a Russian military holiday. Ukraine said about 20 Russian soldiers were killed in the strike, but Russian authorities have not commented on this. Ms Menshikh was giving a performance in a local dance hall capable of seating around 150 people, according to local reporting.  A video purporting to show the moment of the strike was uploaded to social media. A woman, apparently Ms Menshikh, is seen on stage singing and playing guitar, before an explosion is heard and the hall's lights go out. Ms Menshikh died in hospital of her injuries.  Speaking to the BBC's Ukrainian service, a Ukrainian army spokesperson confirmed media reporting of the strike. Portal, a theatre studio based in St Petersburg associated with Ms Menshikh said an upcoming performance of a play she had previously directed would be dedicated to her memory.  The strike took place around 60km (37 miles) from the front line, in the village of Kumachove.  Kumachove is located in the Donetsk region, in the area of eastern Ukraine occupied by Russia since 2014. Other areas in the Donetsk region have been hotpots of vicious fighting in recent months, particularly the cities of Avdiika and Bakhmut. Russian pro-war bloggers criticised the organisation of the show. A performance concentrating dozens of soldiers in one place made it an obvious target for a Ukrainian strike, they wrote.

"A Ghanaian MP has apologised to Manchester United footballer Harry Maguire after mocking him last year. MP Isaac Adongo was debating the budget when he compared Vice-President Mahamudu Bawumia's economic management to Maguire's performances on the pitch. Maguire has come in for heavy criticism from some fans but fellow footballers have come to his defence. On Tuesday, Mr Adongo said he wanted to correct the record and hailed Maguire as a ""transformational footballer"". He was a ""key player"" for Manchester United, Mr Adongo said during a budget debate. But he did not let up in his criticism of Vice-President Bawumia. ""As for our Maguire, he is now at the IMF, with a cup in hand,"" he added. Mr Bawumia is the head of the government's economic management team as Ghana faces its most severe economic crisis in years. As government debt has soared, the country had to take a $3bn (Â£2.4bn) loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In December 2022 inflation in Ghana reached a record 54% but has since fallen to around 35%. A year ago Mr Adongo compared Mr Bawumia to Harry Maguire, who Mr Adongo said ""became the biggest threat at the centre of the Manchester United defence"". The video of the speech was widely shared on social media. It came amid a torrent of criticism of the footballer. England manager Gareth Southgate has condemned the mockery as ""ridiculous treatment"" and said he's been ""an absolute stalwart"" for the team. Mr Maguire's mother also defended her son and said the abuse he has faced has been ""disgraceful"" and ""unacceptable"". Some Ghanaians have been reacting to Mr Adongo's apology, saying that the Manchester United player has really improved, but the same cannot be said of the managers of the Ghanaian economy.  Others feel such a comparison should not have been made. According to Mr Adongo, the Ghanaian government has had to increase taxes and tariffs on services as part of the agreement with the IMF. This caused widespread anger among voters and triggered protests over the rising cost of living and unemployment in the country. Despite this, Ghana's governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) has selected Mr Bawumia as its candidate for the 2024 elections.  He will be the first Muslim to contest the presidency under the NPP's banner since multi-party democracy was restored in 1992. Mr Bawumia has promised to lead a ""united and energised"" NPP into the election and that it is ""the only party that can transform Ghana"".

"Denise Morgan was shot dead in New York The sisters of an Irish woman killed in an apparent murder-suicide have warned of ignoring ""red flags"" in relationships. Mother-of-one Denise Morgan, 39, who was originally from Tullyallen in County Louth, was found dead at a property in Queens, New York City, on 21 October. The New York Police Department said ""a firearm was recovered in the vicinity of [a] deceased male"", who they identified as her former partner, 33-year-old Joed Taveras. ""We are speaking as Deniseâs voice, just to try and raise awareness about domestic violence,"" Lisa Morgan told RTÃ Prime Time. ""You have to make a plan to not let them know youâre going... you have to get out."" Lisa and Shannon Morgan said they wanted to raise awareness about domestic violence Denise Morgan initially moved to New York seven years ago with her ex-husband and daughter. After the marriage ended amicably, she became involved with Mr Taveras. Denise's sisters told RTÃ he subjected her to years of coercive abuse, which Lisa witnessed during a visit to New York two years ago. The abuse had become increasingly physical in recent months, they added. The family have shared text messages received from Denise in the weeks before her death, in which she said he had strangled her. On another instance, Mr Taveras is said to have held a knife to her throat. ""She found out that he was cheating on her, thatâs when it started getting physicalâ¦ he knew that she was leaving him, he just couldnât handle that,"" Shannon said. ""She was constantly always telling us what was going on and it was worrying us more."" The sisters said they felt ""helpless"" when speaking to Denise. ""We knew she was in a bad situation...thatâs the guilt thatâs going to live with us forever is knowing what could have been,"" Shannon added. Irish woman found dead after shooting in New York Domestic abuse issues should be taught at school Watch: Is This Coercive Control? Denise was due to move into a new apartment 10 days after she was killed. It is understood she had ended her relationship with Mr Taveras, to which he responded violently. ""He shot her in the back of the head, she tried to run away from him, she screamed 'no' while he shot her,"" Lisa Morgan said. ""The detective told us everything, what the neighbours reported, there was fighting and then there was the gunshot, and 10 seconds later there was a second gunshot."" The sisters said they want to raise awareness about domestic abuse, warning people to notice ""red flags"" in their relationships. ""Donât hide anything from your family, sometimes as women we tend to ignore this behaviour - the jealousy, the controlling - and youâre embarrassed to speak out about it because you know that youâre going to go back to the abuser,"" Shannon Morgan said.  ""It's shame, it's embarrassing. ""She knew that she had to get out, but unfortunately she didnât get time to get out. ""Theyâre never going to change, walk when you see the red flags. ""The first couple of months with someone you can tell how theyâre going to behave in a relationship, which he did, he did show it, he was always jealous."" The sisters said they are still coming to terms with Denise's death The sisters said they were still in shock and are attempting to come to terms with Denise's death.

"A French pilot has been banned from flying after he decapitated a skydiver with the wing of a plane. Nicolas Galy, 40, was struck in the air moments after jumping from the aircraft in July 2018.  The pilot, who has not been named, was found guilty on Tuesday of involuntary manslaughter and given a suspended sentence by Montauban criminal court. The Midi-PyrÃ©nÃ©es Skydiving School Association, which employed the pilot, has been fined 20,000 euros. Half of that amount, 10,000 euros, has been suspended, French media report. According to Le Parisien, immediately after the drop, the pilot of the aircraft began its descent towards the aerodrome tarmac.  Before the skydiver jumped out of the aircraft, there was no consultation on the trajectory the plane would take, the paper said. Citing a hearing on 19 September, the lawyer for the victim's relatives, Emmanuelle Franck, deplored ""a lot of recklessness or negligence"".  The president of the court in south-west France also pointed out a lack of communication between the victim and the pilot. Since the incident, security measures have been strengthened and briefings have become obligatory, the report added.

"Israel and Hamas have reached a deal to exchange 50 of the hostages held in Gaza for a four-day pause in fighting. The agreement should also see 150 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails released and an increase in humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza.  Qatar, the mediator, said a start time would be announced within 24 hours. The US president said the deal would end ""an unspeakable ordeal"" for the hostages and ""alleviate the suffering of innocent Palestinian families"". The Israeli government vowed to complete its war to eliminate Hamas and return the rest of the more than 200 hostages who Hamas gunmen kidnapped during a cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed. Hamas - which Israel, the US and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation - said the deal would give Palestinians time to recover after an intense Israeli air and ground assault which its government in Gaza has said has killed more than 14,000 people.  After talks continued late into the early hours of Wednesday morning, Israel's coalition government finally signed off on this deal. A statement from the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that 50 women and children would be released over four days, during which time ""a pause in the fighting will be held"". It also offered Hamas an incentive to release more, saying: ""The release of every additional 10 hostages will result in one additional day in the pause."" The BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem says this is important for the hostages' families, some of whom have said they did not want to see a partial deal.  The 50 hostages expected to be released in four batches of 12 under the deal will be Israeli nationals or dual nationals, rather than foreigners.  No list of names has been published, but a senior US official told reporters that at least three American citizens - including three-year-old Abigail Idan, whose parents were killed on 7 October - would be among them. A senior Israeli official said on Tuesday afternoon that Hamas could also unilaterally release the 26 Thai nationals believed to be among the hostages.  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has said it is ready to facilitate any releases, as its staff did when Hamas freed two Israeli-American women and two Israeli women last month.  Israeli forces operating inside Gaza have also rescued one female soldier and recovered the bodies of two other female hostages - a soldier and a civilian. The Israeli government also said it would ""continue the war in order to return home all of the hostages, complete the elimination of Hamas and ensure that there will be no new threat to the State of Israel from Gaza"". A longer Hamas statement gave more details of what Israeli military action was expected to cease for the duration of what it called a ""hudna"", or temporary truce.   It said all drone and Israeli aircraft activity was expected to stop for four days in the south of Gaza.  But in the north - which has been the main target of Israeli operations to dismantle Hamas - the same will only hold between 10:00 and 16:00 local time (08:00-14:00 GMT) each day. Israeli troops and tanks are expected to remain in their positions inside Gaza during the four-day pause, but the Hamas statement said Israeli forces would not attack or arrest anyone. For Palestinians in Gaza, 1.7 million of whom have fled their homes, a respite in the brutal fighting cannot come soon enough, our correspondent says.   The deal will allow 200 lorries carrying aid, four fuel tankers and four lorries carrying gas to enter Gaza via Egypt's Rafah crossing on each of the four days.  But it is understood that the boost in fuel - desperately needed for hospital generators, water desalination and sewage facilities - will only last for as long as the pause.  Israel cut off electricity and most water, and stopped deliveries of food, fuel and other goods to Gaza in retaliation for Hamas's attack.  It has allowed 1,399 lorryloads of humanitarian supplies to enter via Egypt over the past month, compared to a monthly average of 10,000 before the war, according to the UN. It blocked all fuel deliveries until a week ago, saying that it could be stolen by Hamas and used for military purposes.  And although the deal will allow people in Gaza safe passage from north to south, it will not permit the hundreds of thousands of displaced people from the north to return home. Hamas said that the deal would also see 150 Palestinian prisoners - all women and children - released by Israel. The Israeli government statement did not mention that, but on Wednesday morning its justice ministry published a list in Hebrew of the names of 300 prisoners eligible for release as part of the deal - based on the possibility that Hamas would agree to release more hostages Five are as young as 14 years old, imprisoned for offences ranging from throwing firebombs to arson, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.  Our correspondent says the reason the list had to be published is because of a legal formality in Israel. Ahead of any prisoner release, Israeli citizens must be allowed 24 hours to make an appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court. However no serious holdups are expected. Israel is currently holding about 7,000 Palestinians accused or convicted of security offences, according to Israeli and Palestinian rights groups. Almost 3,000 Palestinians are reported to have been arrested in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, where violence has also surged, since 7 October.    Hamas's statement ended by saying the deal aimed to ""serve our people and strengthen their steadfastness in the face of aggression"". It also warned: ""Our fingers remain on the trigger, and our victorious fighters will remain on the look out to defend our people and defeat the occupation.""

"The four BTS band members who have yet to start mandatory military service have begun the process of enlisting. The K-pop stars' label asked fans to continue giving support to RM, Jimin, V and Jung Kook until they return safely from conscription. In South Korea nearly all able-bodied men are obliged to enlist, like the three older band members currently serving.  The group are due to reform in 2025. ""We would like to inform our fans that RM, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook have initiated the military enlistment process,"" label Big Hit Music said in a statement. ""We ask you for your continued love and support."" It comes after older band member Jin enlisted last year, followed by his bandmate J-Hope in April. A third member Suga started service as a social service agent, after being ""ruled unfit for the regular combat duty"". BTS went on a hiatus in June to allow members to complete military service after earning six number one singles in the US. Previously there had been years-long debate on whether BTS deserved an exemption, on the basis they generated billions of dollars for the country and boosted the image of South Korea.  Earlier this year, chairman of the seven-man band's agency said making BTS do their military service was slowing the global growth of K-pop. South Korea offers exemptions from military service to some people, including Olympic medal-winning athletes and some classical musicians, but not K-pop stars. In September it was confirmed all seven members of the group had renewed their contracts with their music label.

"The UK economy will grow much more slowly than previously thought over the next two years as inflation takes longer to come down, the government's economic forecaster has warned.  The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the economy would grow by 0.7% in 2024 and 1.4% in 2025. That is down from a forecast in March of 1.8% and 2.5%. The OBR added that the rate of UK price rises would not return to normal until 2025, a year later than expected.  However, the outlook, which was published alongside the chancellor's Autumn Statement, suggested that government borrowing and debt would both be lower than previously forecast. The spending watchdog, which is independent from government, publishes two sets of economic forecasts a year, which are used to predict what will happen to government finances. These are based on its best guess about what will happen, and are subject to change.  What is the Autumn Statement and when is it?

"Shrewsbury is in mourning after four teenage friends were killed in a crash in north Wales. People in the town told the BBC it would be a long time before they would make sense of the tragedy. The stage was set in Market Square for the Christmas lights switch-on, an event that draws thousands for music, merriment and a night of festive shopping. Instead, the only crowds gathering in Shrewsbury are those of students - solemn and silent, consumed with shock and grief over the deaths of their friends. The switch-on is cancelled, the start of late-night shopping delayed for a week. Celebrating Christmas is the last thing on anyone's mind here. Wilf Fitchett, Jevon Hirst, Harvey Owen and Hugo Morris were students at Shrewsbury College. As news of their deaths filtered through yesterday, the college was closed for a teacher training day.  Arriving back today, students laid flowers at the English Bridge campus. Messages of ""love you"" and ""rest in peace"" have been written on the stone stairs. Molly Clarkson said she knew all the boys, meeting Jevon first at primary school. ""Wilf sits in my English class and today the teacher was crying,"" she said. ""There is an undisputed sadness. They were all best friends."" At Shrewsbury Abbey, dozens of students have been going to light candles in the church. Steve Swindon, church administrator, watched as nine boys stood in silence at the altar after laying flowers. ""What they are experiencing is hard to contemplate. It doesn't matter if you have a faith, it is about humanity,"" he said. ""We are here for everybody. Shrewsbury is a strong community."" The market town is ""one of those places where everyone knows everybody"", said Reverend Charlotte Gompertz, the vicar of Shelton and Oxon. The news of the boys' deaths is ""utterly devastating"", she said. ""It's impacting everyone, this is a tight-knit community where many of the young people have been at school together since they were four years old. ""It is going to take a long time for us to get our heads even vaguely around this tragedy."" In a statement, Shrewsbury Colleges Group called it ""truly heartbreaking"" and ""tragic"" and said ""our thoughts go out to those affected"". The group said it would be working directly with affected students and staff and had ""put in place a range of support measures for all our community"". Meole Brace School in Shrewsbury, which the four teenagers previously attended, said in a statement earlier on Tuesday that all four boys were well-thought of and well-known by the school community. Harvey was well known because he worked in the kitchen of popular local pizza restaurant Dough and Oil, his friends said. It has closed for the day as a mark of respect. ""Harvey, our boy,"" the restaurant team wrote on its Instagram page, alongside a picture of him in his work uniform, a bowl of pasta in his hand, taken just two weeks ago. ""Easy going, funny, gentle, bright, hard-working and humble - we all had a soft spot for Harvey,"" it went on. He had started working there two years ago on the pot wash, and had dreams of opening his own bakery. A post from the restaurant said: ""Our love, thoughts and condolences go out to Harvey's family and to those of his friends, their lives so full of promise cut so tragically short."" Down the road from Dough and Oil, Shane Swannick has put four candles in the window of Shropshire Cycle Hub.  ""As a parent of teenagers, I really feel it,"" he said. ""My son, he's 19 now and he goes to Snowdonia with his mates mountain-biking all the time. ""I used to - as lads you go with your mates, that's what you do.  ""But it can end, just like that.""

"This video can not be played Changing of the Guard, Gangnam style In another sign of the King's K-pop diplomacy, the members of South Korean girl group Blackpink have been presented with honorary MBEs. It comes during the state visit by South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol, in which King Charles had praised the global reach of Korean pop culture. Blackpink were name-checked by the King for supporting environmental causes. ""I can only admire how they can prioritise these vital issues, as well as being global superstars,"" he said. The MBEs recognise how the girl group acted as ambassadors for the COP climate change summit during the UK's presidency, and have been advocates for the UN's sustainable development goals, helping to bring the environmental message to ""millions of young people"". There was a special investiture this morning in the 1844 room in Buckingham Palace, often used for the most distinguished guests. It was another reflection of the red carpet being rolled out during this South Korean state visit, with the diplomatic courtship reflecting the increasing importance of this strategic ally and economic partner. The members of Blackpink - Roseanne Park, Jennie Kim, Jisoo Kim and Lalisa Manoban - are now honorary members of the Order of the British Empire and were guests at the state banquet in Buckingham Palace on Tuesday evening. The King's speech had highlighted the global reach of South Korean popular culture and its ""remarkable ability to captivate imaginations"". While the King admitted to a personal lack of ""what might be called Gangnam Style"", the military band for the changing of the guard put that right on Wednesday morning, by playing the song in a surprise change of musical direction. Tourists gathered outside Buckingham Palace to watch changing of the guard had heard an unexpected medley of K-pop songs, rather than marching tunes. There had been a full ceremonial welcome for South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Tuesday - greeted by the King, Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, before taking part in a carriage procession along the Mall. In the evening, the president was given the grand spectacle of a state banquet, held in the Buckingham Palace ballroom, with 170 guests including the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron as well the Royal Family and South Korean dignitaries. State visits are a mix of serious diplomacy as well as pageantry - and the focus of the South Korean visit is on boosting trade links and military partnerships. South Korea's President Yoon is meeting Mr Sunak to sign a ""Downing Street Accord"", with plans for a new trade deal, with technology and green energy likely to be areas of co-operation. There are plans for a stronger approach to enforcing sanctions against North Korea, and preventing its ""illegal weapons programme"", with joint sea patrols between the South Korean navy and the UK's Royal Navy. ""Long term, global partnerships are vital to our prosperity and security,"" Mr Sunak said.

"Storm Babet led to widespread flooding in parts of Scotland Slow progress adapting to the effects of climate change will put Scotland at increasing risk, advisors warn.   The Climate Change Committee (CCC) has raised ""serious concern"" over the ""damaging cascading impacts"" from severe weather.   It highlights insufficient plans for protecting water supply with gaps in drought resilience and reducing leaks.   The Scottish government said it would consult on a new set of adaptation plans in January.  The criticism comes from the committee's second progress report into how Scotland is adapting to the impacts of climate change. It highlighted the significant flooding experienced last month from Storm Babet and last year's record breaking summer temperatures. The report said heatwaves and heavy rainfall are being made more intense by climate change and that those recent weather extremes highlight the urgency with which climate adaptation must be addressed. Chris Stark, CCC Chief Executive, said: ""Progress on adapting to climate change remains too slow.  ""While there have been some notable steps forward on policy, this isn't being matched in the delivery and implementation of adaptation measures in Scotland."" The committee added that the Scottish government's new plan must ""drive real improvements"" which prepare Scotland for the changes in the climate. Net-zero secretary Mairi McAllan said the climate emergency is not a distant threat The average global temperature has already risen by about 1.2C since the start of the industrial revolution with its impact already being felt on our weather systems. On Monday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Gutteres accused world leaders of a failure of leadership in tackling global warning. Ahead of the latest climate change talks in Dubai, he urged countries to go further in reducing greenhouse gas emissions which cause the planet to warm. But even if the globally agreed target is met, to limit warming to 1.5 - 2C, the impacts of climate change will still be felt. The Scottish government has insisted it is taking action to make Scotland more resilient to the changing climate including investing Â£42m per year managing flood risks. Net-zero secretary Mairi McAllan said: ""We know the climate emergency is not a distant threat - it is with us today.  ""Storms have battered Scotland in recent months and 2023 is set to be the hottest year on record. The impacts of climate change are affecting families, communities and businesses across Scotland."" She thanked the committee for its report and said its recommendations will play an important role in shaping future adaptation plans. The report concludes that there have been several ""notable"" steps forward on adaptation policy over the past 18 months but that ""important gaps remain."" It said the overall progress on adapting to climate change has been slow, particularly when it comes to implementation of policies. And it said the new plan, due in the new year, must ensure there are ""quantified targets"" for climate resilience with a ""clear ownership"" of delivery.

"Scotland's only oil refinery could cease operations as soon as 2025 under plans announced by owners Petroineos. Oil operations at Grangemouth can be traced back more than 100 years to 1919, with the refinery established in 1924. It was one of the first crude oil refineries in the UK. It is currently the primary supplier of aviation fuel for Scotland's main airports, and a major supplier of petrol and diesel ground fuels across the Central Belt. The 1,700-acre site supplies 70% of the fuel to Scotland's filling stations as well Northern Ireland and the north of England. It also provides power to the Forties oil pipeline, which brings oil and gas ashore from the North Sea. BBC Scotland News takes a look back at the site's history. The oil operations at Grangemouth can be traced back to 1919, when Scottish Oils was formed.  It brought together the businesses including that of Dr James ""Paraffin"" Young, who opened the world's first oil works near Bathgate, West Lothian, in 1851.  Scottish Oils was acquired by a company which later became BP.  Grangemouth was an attractive location for a refinery because of its transport links and the availability of local skilled labour thanks to the Bathgate works.   By 1924, the BP refinery was in operation.  Until the outbreak of war in 1939, it maintained a throughput of 360,000 tonnes per year. It was forced to close as oil imports dwindled.  The refinery re-opened in 1946. From the 1950s, operations grew to meet demand for petrochemicals and fuels. British Petroleum Chemicals was established in 1947 to research petrochemicals.  It decided to locate its site adjacent to the existing refinery.  The advent of a new source of crude oil feedstock in the shape of North Sea oil brought further business in the 1970s.  The opening of the Forties Pipeline - which carries crude oil from North Sea installations to the nearby Kinneil terminal - in 1975 was another key development.    The 235-mile system links 85 North Sea oil and gas assets to the mainland. It comes ashore at Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire, and onwards to Kinneil. The pipeline relies on the refinery for steam and electricity to function. In 2017, Ineos acquired the pipeline.  Ineos - a company owned by Britain's richest man Jim Ratcliffe - bought Innovene, owners of the Grangemouth site, in 2005 in a Â£5bn takeover.  Three years later the 1,700-acre plant was closed when about 1,200 staff went on strike over proposed changes including an end to its final salary pension scheme for new workers. The industrial action led to the Forties pipeline temporarily shutting down.  It was the first time production at Grangemouth, which processes 210,000 barrels of oil a day, has been completely halted and led to worries about short-term fuel shortages.  In 2013, another dispute with the union led to the plant being threatened with closure - which would have resulted in the loss of 800 jobs.  Unite the Union balloted for strike action in a dispute over a disciplinary case against a union organiser and the use of temporary workers. This was dropped, but Ineos proceeded to shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions - which included ending the final salary pension scheme and cutting shift allowances. This was coupled with a survival plan which included a Â£300m investment to keep the site open. It was ultimately accepted by the union. While the petrochemical plant is wholly owned by Ineos, the refinery is owned by Petroineos - a joint venture between Ineos and PetroChina.  Ineos announced with great fanfare the arrival of the first shipment of shale gas from the US in 2016. Shale gas, which can be recovered through fracking, is used at Grangemouth to create plastic pellets for general manufacturing.  The pellets are made from ethane, which Ineos used to get from North Sea natural gas. This video can not be played The BBC's David Shukman explains how fracking works However, the company says in the last decade supplies have diminished and at times the pellet-making process has been running at half speed. Since 2016, the Grangemouth facility has used shale shipped from the USA.  This video can not be played Tanker carrying shale gas arrives in Scotland Following the Scottish government's fracking consultation, an ""effective ban"" was put in place in 2017 following ""overwhelming opposition"".  Ineos and another petrochemical firm sought a judicial review, but lost in court - though for an unexpected reason. The judge sided with the government, who argued that in reality there was no ban in place as the policymaking process was still ongoing. However, the moratorium in Scotland continues, in contrast to the pro-fracking stance of the UK government.  Environmental campaigners oppose fracking, which they say can cause pollution, quakes, and undermine efforts to tackle climate change. In February 2019, Â£1bn worth of investment was announced in the UK by Ineos.  This included building a Â£350m energy plant at Grangemouth, and Â£500m for overhauling the Forties pipeline.  However,  owners Petroineos has now said Grangemouth has been facing significant challenges because of global market pressures. Petroineos intends to turn the site into a fuels import terminal which would result in the loss of at least 400 jobs. Work to transform the site is expected to take 18 months. The firm said its new terminal would be able to import petrol, diesel, aviation fuel and kerosene into Scotland. Trade union Unite has said it would ""leave no stone unturned"" in its fight to save jobs at Grangemouth.

"A new campaign warning parents, carers and children of the dangers of vaping has been launched by the Scottish government. It is part of a plan to save thousands of lives a year by making the country tobacco-free by 2034. Smoking is responsible for more than 8,000 deaths a year in Scotland.  A separate UK-wide consultation on creating a smoke-free generation closes next month. Public Health Minister Jenni Minto said the Scottish government was working towards a ban on disposable vapes and suggested it could be in place by 2025.   She also said there was the possibility of action on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's plan to raise the age of tobacco purchase every year. It would mean a 14-year-old now could not legally purchase products in the future. Ms Minto said smoking damaged lives and was responsible for one in five deaths in Scotland. She added: ""It causes preventable ill health and loss of life of loved ones, is a significant burden on our NHS and social care services, and is the leading preventable cause of health inequalities and costs the economy millions each year in lost productivity. ""Although we have seen smoking rates decline, and Scotland has already introduced a range of world-leading tobacco control measures, we want to do more to help us achieve our goal of being tobacco-free by 2034.  ""This framework will provide direction for a decade and allow us to be more responsive in dealing with a variety of nicotine and tobacco products."" In June a Scottish government report found that 22% of all under-18s - around 78,000 - are believed to have used a vape last year with more young people using them than smoking cigarettes. The minister said e-cigarettes were one of a range of tools for adult smokers to quit smoking but ""should never be used by young people or adult non-smokers"".  The new campaign is designed to prevent people becoming addicted in the first place. Ms Minto said: ""It is much easier to never start than it is to give up."" The framework for reaching the 2034 goal includes action to raise the age limit for sales of tobacco and plans to improve services to help people quit.  In addition, the Scottish government will continue to review what further action is needed to limit the appeal of vapes to children, young people and non-smokers during its first phase, which will run until November 2025. The new Take Hold marketing campaign will increase awareness of the harms and risks of nicotine addiction. As well as radio, TV and outdoor advertising, schools across Scotland will be provided with digital guidance packs and resources for posters.  Its key message is that vapes may quickly become harmfully addictive for children and young people, affecting their concentration, mental health and mood. Ministers have also pledged to work with the UK government and the devolved administrations on a four nations approach. Last month Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the Conservative conference that plans to phase out the sale of cigarettes in England would be the ""biggest public health intervention in a generation"". Mr Sunak wants to raise the legal age of smoking every year by a year so that eventually no-one can buy tobacco. Setting a legal smoking age is devolved in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  The proposal to raise the age of sale of cigarettes is similar to laws being introduced in New Zealand, where buying tobacco products will remain banned for anyone born after 2008.

"The mother of one of four teenage boys found in a crashed car says she feels like she's in a nightmare she wishes she could wake up from. Wilf Fitchett, Jevon Hirst, Harvey Owen and Hugo Morris, from Shrewsbury, were found in an overturned, partially submerged car in Gwynedd, north Wales. The boys had not been seen since Sunday morning, prompting a major search. Crystal Owen, Harvey's mother, said: ""Nothing will make this nightmare go away."" ""I just wanted to say I do appreciate people's kindness but no amount of messages is going to help me overcome this,"" she posted on Facebook. Dough and Oil, the restaurant where Harvey worked, said he was ""easy-going, warm, funny, gentle, bright, hardworking and humble"". Maddi Corfield, the girlfriend of Wilf, said: ""I'm going to miss you forever."" ""The sweetest and most loving boy I've ever known. I hope you know how much I love you, gorgeous,"" she wrote in a tribute online. ""Thank you for all the time you've spent with me... thank you for loving me endlessly. I promise I'll do the same for you, my sweet, sweet angel. ""I can't imagine my world without you. I'm missing you so much already, but I am going to enjoy life the way you would've wanted, the way that you made me feel."" Her mother, Lisa Corfield, 37, said on Facebook: ""I am absolutely heartbroken for Maddi and all of the families involved. Wilf was such a lovely, kind lad and treated Maddi in a way only a mother could hope her daughter be treated."" Wilf Fitchett's surname has been changed in our coverage as it was previously provided as Henderson by North Wales Police. James Love, 17, and Alfie Lawley, 16 - both friends of the boys - lit candles for their friends at Shrewsbury Abbey on Wednesday morning. James said they were all ""lovely caring lads, [who] wouldn't say anything horrible to anyone, just amazing people"". ""It's just a horrible feeling... knowing that some lads who were so close to you, that we saw every single day, I'll never see again, I'll never hear their voices again,"" he added. Alfie added: ""It doesn't feel real to think that they're not going to be here any more. I just have no words."" North Wales Police confirmed the bodies were found in the car, which appeared to have come off the road on the A4085 in Garreg, near Tremadog, Gwynedd. The road remained closed on Wednesday. Supt Owain Llewellyn said it ""appears to have been a tragic accident"". Supt Llewellyn said it was thought the group travelled to Harlech on Saturday with plans to camp in Eryri - also called Snowdonia - on Sunday. Garreg is about 75 miles (120km) from Shrewsbury. The boys were last seen in a silver Ford Fiesta, which was found during a police search on Tuesday after a tip-off from a member of the public. The force said the teens' families had been informed, adding that the search had now finished, but inquiries were ongoing to formally identify those in the vehicle, and understand what led to the deaths. ""This has been an extensive search involving a number of different agencies and volunteers and this is sadly not the outcome that any of us would have wanted."" This video can not be played North Wales Police Supt Owain Llewellyn told a press conference that four bodies had been recovered In the village of Garreg locals gathered on Wednesday for a prayer and a minute's silence, and a single candle was placed at the site of the crash. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak sent his condolences, adding:  ""I know the thoughts of the whole House will be with the family and friends of the four teenagers."" Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""My thoughts are with their family and friends during this incredibly difficult time as they deal with the unimaginable."" All four teenagers were students at Shrewsbury College and were doing their A-levels. In a statement, Shrewsbury Colleges Group called it ""truly heartbreaking"" and ""tragic"" and said ""our thoughts go out to those affected"". The group said it would be working directly with affected students and staff and had ""put in place a range of support measures for all our community"". Shrewsbury's Christmas lights switch, on which was due to take place on Wednesday evening, has been cancelled. Meole Brace School in Shrewsbury, which the four teenagers previously attended, said in a statement on Tuesday that all four boys were well-thought of and well-known by the school community. Rev Charlotte Gompertz, vicar of Shelton and Oxon in Shrewsbury, described the news as ""utterly devastating"". ""It's impacting everyone, this is a tight-knit community where many of the young people have been at school together since they were four years old,"" she told Radio 4's Today programme. ""I do know some of the families, not really close, but it is one of those places where everybody knows everybody and certainly some of the families are quite high profile folks within the community.

"A National Insurance cut for millions of workers is expected when Chancellor Jeremy Hunt makes his Autumn Statement on Wednesday. However, previously announced changes to National Insurance (NI) and income tax mean millions of people will pay more in tax.  NI is the second biggest source of money for the government, and applies across the whole of the UK. For employees, it is similar to income tax in many ways. A fixed percentage of the money you earn is deducted from wages. You do not pay NI on the first Â£12,570 you earn every year. It is then charged at 12% on earnings up to Â£50,270, and 2% on income above that. Self-employed people pay 9% on profits between Â£12,571 and Â£50,270, and 2% on profits above that.  NI is not paid by people over state pension age even if they are still working.  Employers also have to pay NI contributions (NICs).  At this stage, it is not clear how much of a reduction Mr Hunt will reveal, although some reports suggest a 1% cut. That could cost the Treasury around Â£5bn. Like income tax, NI payments - which were introduced in 1911 - contribute to the cost of benefits, the NHS and the state pension.  Eligibility for certain benefits including the state pensiondepends on the amount of National Insurance contributions you have paid.  As wages rise, more people will have to pay NI for the first time.  That is because the chancellor has frozen the level of income at which you start paying NI, known as the threshold - currently Â£12,570.  Thresholds used to rise every year, typically in line with inflation. But the chancellor has said they will remain unchanged until April 2028.  The amount of income tax you pay also depends on thresholds:  the levels of income at which people either start paying tax, or have to pay higher rates of tax. These are also being frozen until 2028. This means the tax-free personal allowance will also remain at Â£12,570. Most taxpayers do not pay any tax on income below this level. The point at which higher tax rates take effect will also not change.  As with NI, as wages rise, more people will start paying tax, and more people will qualify for higher rates of tax, increasing the total amount of income tax they pay.  The freezes will create 3.2 million extra taxpayers by 2028, and 2.6 million more people will pay higher rates of tax. That's according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which independently assesses the government's economic plans.  It expects the policy to raise Â£25.5bn more a year by 2027-28 than if the NI and income tax thresholds had gone up in line with the CPI measure of inflation.  You pay the basic rate of income tax on earnings between Â£12,571 and Â£50,270 a year.  The basic rate is 20%, so a fifth of the money you earn between those amounts goes to the government in income tax. The higher rate of income tax is 40%, and is paid on earnings between Â£50,271 and Â£125,140. Once you earn more than Â£100,000 a year, you also start losing your tax-free personal allowance. This means you have to pay income tax of 40% on some of the first Â£12,570 of your earnings.  You lose Â£1 of your personal allowance for every Â£2 that your income goes above Â£100,000. So if you earn more than Â£125,140 a year, you no longer get any tax-free personal allowance.  The additional rate of income tax is 45%, and is paid on all earnings above Â£125,140 a year.  The government says about 629,000 people pay the additional rate of income tax. You pay income tax to the government on earnings from employment and profits from self-employment during the tax year, which runs from 6 April to 5 April the following year.  Income tax is also due on some benefits and pensions, the money you get from renting out property, and returns from savings and investments above certain limits. These rules apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland has different tax rules to the rest of the UK. For most families in the UK, income tax is the single biggest tax they pay. You can see that in the dark green bars in the chart below.  But poorer households tend to pay a bigger share of their taxes through taxes on the money they spend such as VAT and duties, rather than the money they earn. These ""indirect taxes"" are shown in the blue areas in each bar.  For the poorest fifth of households, VAT is the biggest single tax paid. Some income tax rates are different in Scotland because of powers devolved to the Scottish Parliament. These are the Scottish income tax rates from April 2023:  What income taxes will you pay in Scotland? One way of measuring how high taxes are is to consider the amount of tax raised as a proportion of the size of the economy. Under current plans, the amount of money the government takes in tax is forecast to rise to 37.7% of the size of the economy by 2027-28, up from an estimated 36.9% in 2023-2024.  By that measure, it would be the highest level of tax the UK has ever seen. If you look at the amount of tax raised as a proportion of the size of the economy in 2021 - the most recent year for which international comparisons can be made - the figure was 33.5%. That puts the UK right in the middle of the G7 group of big economies. France, Italy and Germany tax more, Canada, Japan and the US tax less.

"The UK economy will grow much more slowly than previously thought over the next two years as inflation takes longer to come down, the government's economic forecaster has warned.  The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the economy would grow by 0.7% in 2024 and 1.4% in 2025. That is down from a forecast in March of 1.8% and 2.5%. The OBR added that the rate of UK price rises would not return to normal until 2025, a year later than expected.  However, the outlook, which was published alongside the chancellor's Autumn Statement, suggested that government borrowing and debt would both be lower than previously forecast. The spending watchdog, which is independent from government, publishes two sets of economic forecasts a year, which are used to predict what will happen to government finances. These are based on its best guess about what will happen, and are subject to change.  What is the Autumn Statement and when is it?

"The culture secretary has said she may order a probe into the sale of the Telegraph newspaper and Spectator magazine to an Abu Dhabi-backed fund, citing ""concerns"" about the deal. Lucy Frazer said she was ""minded to"" issue an intervention notice on public interest grounds. Earlier this week, RedBird IMI said it was poised to take control of the titles. The BBC has approached RedBird IMI for comment. In a written statement on Wednesday, Ms Frazer said had contacted the publication's previous owners the Barclay family, their bank Lloyds and Redbird IMI to inform them of the possible intervention. She said: ""This relates to concerns I have that there may be public interest considerationsâ¦ that are relevant to the intended loan repayment by the Barclay family and the planned acquisition of Telegraph Media Group by Redbird IMI and that these concerns warrant further investigation."" She added: ""It is important to note that I have not taken a final decision on intervention at this stage."" If Ms Frazer does issue an intervention notice, it could lead to an investigation by regulators. The parties have been given until 15:00 GMT on Thursday to respond to the secretary of state. It comes after six Conservative MPs wrote to Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden and the business and culture secretaries over the weekend to raise concerns about how RedBird IMI's offer could affect national security and press freedom. The Telegraph and Spectator were taken over by Lloyds Bank five months ago as it sought to recover debts owed by the Barclay brothers. Lloyds launched a sales process of the business to recover more than Â£1bn that was outstanding. However, on Monday RedBird IMI investment fund, which is a joint venture between US firm RedBird Capital and International Media Investments (IMI) of Abu Dhabi, confirmed it had reached a deal with the Barclays. This would see the debts owed to Lloyds repaid, and the news titles taken out of receivership. If the deal is approved, Redbird IMI's chief executive, former CNN boss Jeff Zucker, would run the business.

"Scotland's only oil refinery could cease operations as soon as 2025 under plans announced by owners Petroineos. Oil operations at Grangemouth can be traced back more than 100 years to 1919, with the refinery established in 1924. It was one of the first crude oil refineries in the UK. It is currently the primary supplier of aviation fuel for Scotland's main airports, and a major supplier of petrol and diesel ground fuels across the Central Belt. The 1,700-acre site supplies 70% of the fuel to Scotland's filling stations as well Northern Ireland and the north of England. It also provides power to the Forties oil pipeline, which brings oil and gas ashore from the North Sea. BBC Scotland News takes a look back at the site's history. The oil operations at Grangemouth can be traced back to 1919, when Scottish Oils was formed.  It brought together the businesses including that of Dr James ""Paraffin"" Young, who opened the world's first oil works near Bathgate, West Lothian, in 1851.  Scottish Oils was acquired by a company which later became BP.  Grangemouth was an attractive location for a refinery because of its transport links and the availability of local skilled labour thanks to the Bathgate works.   By 1924, the BP refinery was in operation.  Until the outbreak of war in 1939, it maintained a throughput of 360,000 tonnes per year. It was forced to close as oil imports dwindled.  The refinery re-opened in 1946. From the 1950s, operations grew to meet demand for petrochemicals and fuels. British Petroleum Chemicals was established in 1947 to research petrochemicals.  It decided to locate its site adjacent to the existing refinery.  The advent of a new source of crude oil feedstock in the shape of North Sea oil brought further business in the 1970s.  The opening of the Forties Pipeline - which carries crude oil from North Sea installations to the nearby Kinneil terminal - in 1975 was another key development.    The 235-mile system links 85 North Sea oil and gas assets to the mainland. It comes ashore at Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire, and onwards to Kinneil. The pipeline relies on the refinery for steam and electricity to function. In 2017, Ineos acquired the pipeline.  Ineos - a company owned by Britain's richest man Jim Ratcliffe - bought Innovene, owners of the Grangemouth site, in 2005 in a Â£5bn takeover.  Three years later the 1,700-acre plant was closed when about 1,200 staff went on strike over proposed changes including an end to its final salary pension scheme for new workers. The industrial action led to the Forties pipeline temporarily shutting down.  It was the first time production at Grangemouth, which processes 210,000 barrels of oil a day, has been completely halted and led to worries about short-term fuel shortages.  In 2013, another dispute with the union led to the plant being threatened with closure - which would have resulted in the loss of 800 jobs.  Unite the Union balloted for strike action in a dispute over a disciplinary case against a union organiser and the use of temporary workers. This was dropped, but Ineos proceeded to shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions - which included ending the final salary pension scheme and cutting shift allowances. This was coupled with a survival plan which included a Â£300m investment to keep the site open. It was ultimately accepted by the union. While the petrochemical plant is wholly owned by Ineos, the refinery is owned by Petroineos - a joint venture between Ineos and PetroChina.  Ineos announced with great fanfare the arrival of the first shipment of shale gas from the US in 2016. Shale gas, which can be recovered through fracking, is used at Grangemouth to create plastic pellets for general manufacturing.  The pellets are made from ethane, which Ineos used to get from North Sea natural gas. This video can not be played The BBC's David Shukman explains how fracking works However, the company says in the last decade supplies have diminished and at times the pellet-making process has been running at half speed. Since 2016, the Grangemouth facility has used shale shipped from the USA.  This video can not be played Tanker carrying shale gas arrives in Scotland Following the Scottish government's fracking consultation, an ""effective ban"" was put in place in 2017 following ""overwhelming opposition"".  Ineos and another petrochemical firm sought a judicial review, but lost in court - though for an unexpected reason. The judge sided with the government, who argued that in reality there was no ban in place as the policymaking process was still ongoing. However, the moratorium in Scotland continues, in contrast to the pro-fracking stance of the UK government.  Environmental campaigners oppose fracking, which they say can cause pollution, quakes, and undermine efforts to tackle climate change. In February 2019, Â£1bn worth of investment was announced in the UK by Ineos.  This included building a Â£350m energy plant at Grangemouth, and Â£500m for overhauling the Forties pipeline.  However,  owners Petroineos has now said Grangemouth has been facing significant challenges because of global market pressures. Petroineos intends to turn the site into a fuels import terminal which would result in the loss of at least 400 jobs. Work to transform the site is expected to take 18 months. The firm said its new terminal would be able to import petrol, diesel, aviation fuel and kerosene into Scotland. Trade union Unite has said it would ""leave no stone unturned"" in its fight to save jobs at Grangemouth.

"The firm's new office will be based in the Friargate development next to Coventry's railway station Energy firm Octopus Energy has agreed a deal to open a new office in Coventry. The company said it would initially employ about 150 staff at the office, located in the new Friargate Two building, next to Coventry's railway station. But the city council, which jointly owns the Friargate development with a construction firm, said there was an agreement in place to let the company further expand. The move will mean the closure of the firm's existing office in Leamington Spa. A spokesman for Octopus Energy told the BBC the move was decided after reaching capacity in that office and it also saw moving to a city with two universities as a good opportunity for recruitment. ""Coventry is still close by but has improved transport links for further staff recruitment and retention,"" he added. Octopus Energy currently has an office in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire Remaining in Leamington would stifle their growth, he said, and the new office would open in late January. Staff in the town were set to move to Coventry in February at the earliest but the firm did not confirm if all would relocate. Octopus said it was also expecting to announce the completion of a takeover bid for rival firm, Shell Energy, in the coming weeks, subject to approval by regulator Ofgem. Shell Energy currently employs hundreds of people at its office in Westwood Business Park, Coventry. Octopus said it wasn't able to confirm what would happen with Shell Energy staff until the deal was formally completed but did confirm there was the potential to take additional space at Friargate Two. Councillor Jim O'Boyle described the move as a ""vote of confidence"" in Coventry Councillor Jim O'Boyle, cabinet member for jobs at the council, said the move by the energy firm was a ""vote of confidence"" in Coventry. Asked about the potential to take even more space in the building, Mr O'Boyle said: ""We're in conversation with them. I'm sure when they're in a position to make a further announcement they will.""

"The sudden resignation of Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao has shocked the crypto world. But who is the new boss of Binance, Richard Teng? A native of Singapore, Mr Teng joined the world's largest crypto exchange just over two years ago as the chief executive of Binance's Singapore business. That was the year when Binance came under a Justice Department investigation, and as regulatory scrutiny of the company and Mr Zhao intensified, Mr Teng was rapidly climbing the ranks in the background.  He only stayed in his original position as the Singapore CEO for five months, according to his LinkedIn page, before he was promoted to regional head of Europe, Asia and the Middle East and North Africa in April 2023.  Mr Teng later moved on to become head of regional markets this May before he was appointed to the top job on Tuesday - just slightly more than two years after he was first employed by Binance.  In announcing his successor, Mr Zhao called Mr Teng a ""highly qualified leader"", adding that ""with over three decades of financial services and regulatory experience, he will navigate the company through its next period of growth"". Prior to joining Binance, Mr Teng worked in the more traditional financial and regulatory sectors as a director of corporate finance at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and a chief regulatory officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX). He then moved on to the become chief executive of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), an international financial centre in the United Arab Emirates, where he stayed for six years. The ADGM regulates the trading of digital assets.  In a statement on Wednesday, Mr Teng said he was honoured to step into the role, adding that he would focus on reassuring Binance's 150 million users about ""the financial strength, security and safety of the company"". But his new role will come with its fair share of challenges. Retaining customer confidence will be an item on Mr Teng's agenda, with Binance having suffered reputational damage in recent months.  In March, US regulators sought to ban the company, alleging it had been operating in the country illegally. It was also accused of breaking numerous US financial laws, including rules intended to thwart money laundering.  The Justice Department later ordered Binance to pay $4.3bn (Â£3.4bn) in penalties and forfeitures. Despite this, Mr Teng has reiterated that Binance is ""here to stay"", adding that company's foundation stands ""stronger than ever"".

"After the shock dismissal of Sam Altman, OpenAI directors are reportedly in talks for a possible reinstatement. Discussions are taking place between the former CEO and at least one board member, according to reports citing people familiar with the matter.  Almost every staff member at OpenAI has threatened to leave unless Mr Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman are reinstated. Microsoft, the biggest investor in OpenAI, has since offered him a job.  According to reports by Bloomberg and the Financial Times, the artificial intelligence company is exploring various options, including bringing Mr Altman back in his former position or as a board director.  It is still unclear whether Mr Altman will join Microsoft which has also offered to match the pay of any staff who join it from OpenAI. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has said he was ""committed to OpenAI and Sam, irrespective of what configuration"". ""Obviously that depends on the people at OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft, so I'm open to both options,"" he told news site CNBC. Emmett Shear, the former head of Twitch who has been named the new interim head of OpenAI, is also reportedly part of negotiations. Last week, the board decided to remove Mr Altman which led to Mr Brockman's resignation, sending the star AI company into chaos. The decision was made by the three non-employees board members, Adam D'Angelo, Tasha McCauley and Helen Toner, and a third co-founder and the firm's chief scientist Ilya Sutskever. Mr Sutskever has since apologised on X, formerly known as Twitter, and signed the letter calling on the board to reverse course. Unusually for a company that is reportedly valued at $80bn (Â£63.8bn), the company's board comprised of just six people as of last week.  Evan Morikawa, an engineering manager at OpenAI, has said that 743 out of 770 employees at OpenAI have signed a letter calling on the board to resign - with staff themselves threatening to leave if their demands are not met.

"This video can not be played Watch: The rise is worth Â£1,800 for full-time workers, says the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Laura Trott The minimum wage is to increase by more than a pound to Â£11.44 per hour from April next year. The minimum wage, known officially as the National Living Wage, is currently Â£10.42 an hour for workers over 23. But Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has decided the rate will also apply to 21 and 22-year-olds for the first time. It means a full-time worker aged 23 on the wage would receive a rise worth Â£1,800 a year. A 21-year-old would see an effective Â£2,300 annual rise. The policy change comes ahead of Mr Hunt's Autumn Statement, which will see the chancellor outline the government's latest tax and spending decisions. Mr Hunt told the Conservative Party conference in October that the minimum wage was set to rise above Â£11 in April, but the confirmed rises represent a 9.8% increase for over-23s on last year, and a 12.4% jump for workers aged 22 and 21.  The current minimum wage for those aged 21-22 is Â£10.18 an hour. The separate National Minimum Wage for 18-20-year-olds will also increase to Â£8.60 an hour from Â£7.49, meaning in total, the above-inflation wage hikes will benefit 2.7 million low-paid workers. Apprentices will also get a rise, with an hourly pay increase of over 20%, going from Â£5.28 to Â£6.40 an hour.  The chancellor accepted the proposals in full from the Low Pay Commission, which advises the government on the minimum wage, saying that the Conservatives' target to ""end low pay"" by lifting the living wage to two-thirds of a measure of average earnings, had now been met. ""The National Living Wage has helped halve the number of people on low pay since 2010, making sure work always pays,"" Mr Hunt said. Bryan Sanderson, chair of the Low Pay Commission, said the recommendation of increasing the minimum wage to Â£11.44 ""attempts to steer a path"" through a ""high degree of political and economic uncertainty"". The move comes as the higher cost of living has led to household budgets being squeezed, with people on low incomes the hardest hit by higher energy and food bills. But such pay rises have not been without concern from some in industry. Last year's similar rise led to retail and hospitality businesses voicing worries over higher wage bills. Responding to the announcement, Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the hospitality industry body UK Hospitality, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the rise was ""a reminder that although government announces it, it is businesses who deliver it and why it is so vital other action is taken to reduce tax and costs, particularly [business] rates.""

"UK inflation might not fall as quickly as some are hoping, the governor of the Bank of England has warned.  Andrew Bailey told MPs that Bank policymakers were more worried about the pace of price rises remaining high than financial markets appear to be.  Speaking to the Treasury Committee he said the Bank was concerned over the ""potential persistence"" of inflation. Inflation fell to 4.6% in October from 6.7% in September, according to official figures. That drop - measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) - prompted the government to claim it had met its inflation target early, having pledged to bring down the level to below 5.4% by the end of the year.  Speaking ahead of the Autumn Statement on Wednesday, and as speculation mounts about possible tax cuts, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: ""We met our pledge to halve inflation, but we must keep on supporting the Bank of England to drive inflation down to 2%. That means being responsible with the nation's finances."" Mr Bailey told the Treasury Committee that the rapid fall in inflation was good news, but that it could take some time before the Bank's target of 2% was hit. ""We are concerned about the potential persistence of inflation as we go through the remainder of the journey down to 2%, and I think the market is underestimating that,"" he said. Up until September, the Bank had raised rates 14 times in a row to tame soaring inflation, which has been squeezing household budgets. But it has now left rates on hold - at 5.25% - in its past two meetings. On Monday, Mr Bailey had said it was ""far too early to be thinking about rate cuts"". Earlier on Tuesday, official figures showed government borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - in October was a higher-than-expected Â£14.9bn, largely pushed up by higher benefit payments. But the data, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), also showed a smaller-than-expected deficit across the first half of the financial year, helped by higher tax receipts reflecting higher wages and inflation. The ONS said the government had borrowed Â£98.3bn in total since the start of the financial year. That is Â£21.9bn more than a year earlier, but less than the Â£115.2bn that was forecast by the UK's independent fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), in March. The figures on the health of the public finances are mixed news for the chancellor as he puts the finishing touches to Wednesday's Autumn Statement, and a reminder that he may opt not to give households large tax cuts yet. Some economists think the chancellor will now meet his self-imposed rules on borrowing with around Â£20bn to spare, which has raised speculation of tax cuts. Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics said: ""With the election drawing nearer, the chancellor may not be able to resist the temptation to unveil a pre-election splash."" However, any pre-election splash in 2024 ""will almost certainly be followed by hefty tax rises in 2025 after the election,"" she added. Sir John Gieve, a former deputy governor for fiscal stability at the Bank of England, said the government's finances had been improved by higher wages and higher inflation, which had increased receipts from income tax and VAT . ""He hasn't increased tax thresholds [on income tax]. The question is: should he give a little of this back?"" he asked. But others expect the focus of Wednesday's statement will be on helping business, with households perhaps having to wait until next spring for announcements on substantial giveaways. Responding to the ONS data, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the latest figures provided ""a timely reminder that the task of restoring the public finances to a sustainable footing is far from complete"".  He also predicted that the majority of any tax cuts announced in the Autumn Statement are not likely to come into effect until after the next general election.

"Deliveroo cannot be legally compelled to engage with a union representing its riders for the purposes of collective bargaining, judges have ruled. The decision is the latest in a long-running dispute, which began when a union tried to represent a group of riders over pay and conditions. The case was previously dismissed by lower courts but an appeal was brought to the Supreme Court. However, judges at the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the appeal. Judge Vivien Rose said Deliveroo riders did not have an ""employment relationship"" with the food courier company and were not entitled to compulsory collective bargaining. In a judgement, Lady Rose, along with Lord Lloyd-Jones, said multiple factors, including riders being free to decline offers of work and to work for Deliveroo's competitors, were ""fundamentally inconsistent"" with such a relationship. Collective bargaining is an official process in which trade unions negotiate with employers on behalf of their members. The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which brought the case, said the ruling was a disappointment. ""As a union we cannot accept that thousands of riders should be working without key protections like the right to collective bargaining,"" it said in a statement, adding it would continue to explore legal avenues. ""Whether reflected in legislation or not, couriers are joining the union in ever bigger numbers and building our collective power to take action and hold companies like Deliveroo to account,"" it added. The case follows a number of claims brought by workers in the so-called ""gig"" economy in recent years, demanding rights such as holiday pay, the minimum wage and pensions contributions. In 2017, the IWGB was first refused permission to represent riders on the basis they were not classed as ""workers"" under UK labour law. It put forward a legal case, but riders were ruled to be self-employed by labour law body the Central Arbitration Committee (CAC). The union has since been mounting a number of appeals, reaching the Supreme Court. Part of the case, which was rejected on Tuesday, focused on whether the arrangement between the food courier and its riders fell under the scope of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights - which covers the right to join trade unions. But judges rejected this argument. The Supreme Court has said there is nothing in UK legislation to stop riders from forming or joining a union, and nothing to prevent Deliveroo engaging in collective bargaining with it. But its ruling added: ""The issue is whether Article 11 requires the United Kingdom to go beyond that current position and to enact legislation conferring on Article 11 workers the right to require their reluctant employer to recognise and negotiate with the union of their choice."" A Deliveroo spokesperson said that the UK had ""repeatedly and at every level"" confirmed that its riders are self-employed. ""This is a positive judgment for Deliveroo riders, who value the flexibility that self-employed work offers,"" the spokesperson added. However, the IWGB argued: ""Flexibility, including the option for account substitution, is no reason to strip workers of basic entitlements like fair pay and collective bargaining rights."" Deliveroo said it had agreed a ""voluntary partnership agreement"" with the GMB Union in 2021 which gave the union collective bargaining rights on pay and consultation rights, on benefits and other issues, while still recognising riders as self-employed.

"If your inbox currently looks like this: ""Buy now!"" ""Don't miss out!"" ""Deals end soon!""... it can only mean it's Black Friday again. With the cost-of-living crisis, lots of us will be looking for crossed-out prices and big yellow stickers. But research by consumer advice group Which? suggests we might not be getting the deal we bargained for. Before you click ""add to basket"", BBC Newsbeat's asked some experts for their top tips on resisting temptation. Which? has published analysis of 208 deals at eight major shops on Black Friday 2022, tracking the price of the items every day for the six months before and after the big day. It found that only five of the 208 products - 2% - were at their lowest price during the November sales.  So this is not your only chance to get a good deal. ""There are plenty of opportunities throughout the year when you can find the same products for the same price or maybe even cheaper than Black Friday,"" says Harry Kind, from Which?. The magazine's research found Apple Airpods on sale in May 2022 for Â£99-Â£109 before going up to Â£139 a few months later. That meant when they were priced at Â£119 for Black Friday they were marked as Â£20 off, but you could have saved an extra Â£20 earlier in the year. Obviously, that doesn't help much if you're looking to bag a cut-price Christmas gift in November, but seeing a discount can push you into a purchase. Harry advises to ""ignore that 'was' price and just focus on the now price because that's what's important"". ""In amongst these deals are some deals that are too good to be true,"" says Harry. ""If you see something which is a massive reduction on an item that you know is more expensive elsewhere then be really, really cautious."" He says scammers can create convincing rip-off websites that leave customers with dodgy products or even nothing at all.  Harry suggests being extra cautious when shopping on social media and using a credit card to give you extra protection when making purchases.  Kat Leech, known as Kat Saves on TikTok, shares money-saving tips with her 40,000 followers and says companies try and encourage us to buy items we might not need out of fear we're missing a good deal. ""Getting targeted with ads can be really difficult,"" the 27-year-old says.  Kat, who lives in Manchester, says she turns off marketing emails which tend to clog up your inbox and tempt you into impulse buys - ""one of the worst habits you can have"" when it comes to saving cash. She advises making a list of what we really want to help us avoid being drawn in. ""The main shopping rule that I really live by when it comes to sales like Black Friday is if you were going to buy it anyway, then you're saving money,"" says Kat. ""If you weren't going to buy it, then you're just wasting money."" Kat's ultimate advice is just to reduce what we buy. ""You don't actually have to buy anything on Black Friday, you don't even have to buy anything for Christmas,"" she says.  Harry agrees and says it's more important than ever to make more considered choices. ""If you buy something you don't want, even if it's got all the money off in the world, it's not a good deal,"" says Harry. ""With the cost-of-living crisis, there's never been a better time to see through the corporate nonsense that is Black Friday, so don't feel that FOMO.  ""Make sure you're buying only those things that you really need."" Organisations that can help with debt and money problems can be found via BBC Action Line.
